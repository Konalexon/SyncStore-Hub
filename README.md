## 💎 Project Vision

> "Shopping shouldn't just be a transaction; it should be an event."

In a world dominated by static scroll-and-click interfaces, **SyncStore-Hub** brings the human element back to digital retail. We are building a platform where brands can tell stories, demonstrate products in real-time, and interact directly with their audience.

This isn't just a shop; it's a **broadcast network for commerce**.
